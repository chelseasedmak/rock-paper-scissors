# rock-paper-scissors

This rock-paper-scissors game is the first JavaScript game I’ve ever coded, and it really taught me a lot! Refactoring the code to ensure it worked well with the DOM was tricky at times, but I had a lot of fun figuring it all out. Next time I make a game, I think I’ll focus more on making regular commits to GitHub rather than getting too caught up in the code itself. It’ll help keep things organized and make the process smoother!
